NOTE: THE ESTIMATED TIMES FOR THE MILESTONES IN THE EXAMPLE EQUATE TO THE LENGTH OF THE COURSES WHERE YOU WILL LEARN THE NECESSARY SKILLS. THE PROJECT TIMELINE WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE TIGHTER DEADLINES IN A PROFESSIONAL CONTEXT INVOLVING ACTUAL CLIENTS AND DATA SCIENTISTS. FOR EXAMPLE:

MILESTONE 1: 1-2 DAYS
MILESTONE 2: 2-3 WEEKS
MILESTONE 3: 1 WEEK
MILESTONE 4: 1 WEEK
MILESTONE 5: 1-2 WEEKS
